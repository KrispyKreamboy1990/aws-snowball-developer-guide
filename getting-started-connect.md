1. Open the top door and remove the provided power cable from the cable nook, and plug the appliance into power\.

1. Choose one of your RJ45, SFP\+, or QSFP\+ network cables, and plug the appliance into your network\. The network ports are on the back of the appliance\.

1. Power on the AWS Snowball Edge appliance by pressing the power button above the LCD display\.

1. When the appliance is ready, the LCD display shows a short video while the appliance is getting ready to start\. After about ten minutes, the appliance is ready to be unlocked\.
